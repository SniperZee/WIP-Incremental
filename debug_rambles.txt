why didn't i start one of these before?

alright, trying to make it so you don't have to attack again when the monster has less than 0 hp.

gonna put this here real quick
    console.log("Monster has died.");
    monster.health = monster.maxHealth;
    player.gold += monster.goldReward

    monster.health -= player.attack + player.swordLevel

wait why don't i have it check after attacking? but before the text update?
oh shit that worked
---
now i have a health system for the player, and a way to restore it.
it actually got added with a lot less issues than i thought there'd be.

can I to-do here?
Split main.js into separate files
sweet, main.js is getting kinda crowded.
---
splitting into separate files might be more complicated than i thought. probably won't do it too much.
---
want to make a name generator, gonna have that be separate for now
i love it when i have those "fuck it" moments, and my dumb solution actually ends up working
goddamnit i hate it when it just works. like, i write the thing, and nothing goes wrong?

wow i haven't touched this in ages
okay so i split the js files up, but doing it in like the stupidest simpliest way possible right now
