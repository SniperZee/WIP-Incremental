why didn't i start one of these before?

alright, trying to make it so you don't have to attack again when the monster has less than 0 hp.

gonna put this here real quick
    console.log("Monster has died.");
    monster.health = monster.maxHealth;
    player.gold += monster.goldReward

    monster.health -= player.attack + player.swordLevel

wait why don't i have it check after attacking? but before the text update?
oh shit that worked
---
now i have a health system for the player, and a way to restore it.
it actually got added with a lot less issues than i thought there'd be.

can I to-do here?
